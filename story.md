# KitWork – Building an Engine to See Programming Differently

**I’m building an engine that changes the way we look at programming: a roadmap, a philosophy, and a tool for simplicity, clarity, and creativity.**

## Insomnia and Finding the Path

Lately, I have been losing sleep because, for the first time in ten years, I can see my own path clearly. Last night, in a tiny nine-square-meter room, I listened to the wind outside, my mind wandering among clouds chasing dreams. In ten years, I have never seen programming so clearly. I realized I am standing at the edge of a turning point—a place where the world of programming can be seen differently.

## Roadmap = README

Today, I finished it. **KitWork** is just a README, a roadmap, but for me, it is the map of my life. It contains the essence of my thoughts, my exploration, and the dreams of a programmer chasing freedom and creativity. It brings me closer to the dreams I have pursued for years: technological independence and what I call my *“flowering dream.”*

I do not need a degree to prove anything; this README itself is proof of my journey. It captures knowledge, curiosity, and the heartbeat of a programmer chasing the edges of madness.

## Inspired by Modern Tools

KitWork draws inspiration from **GitHub Actions, n8n, serverless functions, and Docker**. It reminds us that programmers often create solutions for clients, but when we solve problems for ourselves, everything else begins to untangle naturally.

I see a future where programming happens in the simplest files. There is no boundary between front-end and back-end, no separation between programming languages and machine languages. KitWork transforms the most complex systems into something readable, manageable, and deployable by anyone. Every action, every device, every chip can implement it—from the simplest task to the most complex microservices.

## Programming from Simplicity

KitWork does not replace programming languages. It turns no-code and low-code ideas into a fully functional system. It allows people to design workflows, build backends like neatly arranged strings, and replace outdated methods. Logic becomes text that both humans and machines can understand instantly.

The idea came from a simple question: how to make a JavaScript file dynamic without Node.js. From GitHub Actions to serverless functions, I asked why not implement it in **Golang**—fast, efficient, perfect for microservices. I wanted algorithms and dynamic JS files self-contained, easy to read, easy to deploy.

## Open Source and Vision

The name **KitWork** carries meaning: *work* in workflows, *work* in frameworks, and *work* sounds like my own name. It allows shipping projects independently, self-hosting services without relying on SaaS, and managing complex operations like load balancing in a few simple files.

I open-sourced it knowing someone may copy it, but that is a good thing. Open mindset is what improves the world, not just source code. KitWork simplifies complexity, makes systems readable and maintainable, and lays the groundwork for a new programming language: one of simplicity, clarity, and intentionality.

> “Simplicity is not the absence of complexity. It is the art of making the complex understandable.”

## The Awakening

KitWork is the first reality of the programming journey I want to follow. It is a tool to create a future where coding is simple, transparent, free, and full of inspiration. Even the most complex systems can become readable, maintainable, and deployable by anyone. It allows humans and machines to communicate seamlessly.

I can imagine mornings when systems operate automatically. I can see backends built in hours, landing pages in a few hours, entire workflows running seamlessly. This is the future I see—a world where programmers focus on ideas, not boilerplate, where logic becomes readable, and creativity flows without friction.
